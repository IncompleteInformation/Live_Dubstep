General Setup:
	6 wires that light up in as a function of acceleration along with two instrument dependant ones.

	Drive controls the max lumosity of any lit wires. from 0% to 100%

	I want a mouth that opens with the envelopes.

	put an AND gate on one of the customs for the handlights

Ideas:
	inst1 is the quietest instrument.
	inst1 never toggles a custom

	inst2 is a "cryer". it toggles the custom with the eyes
